# Reelo Assignment

## Overview

This repository contains the backend implementation for reelo-assignment. It is built using Express with TypeScript, utilizes JSONDB for data storage, and incorporates Express Validator for input validation.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shivam-kumar-shah/reelo-assignment.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd reelo-assignment
   ```

3. Start the server, this command also installs all relevant dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

## Database Setup

This project uses JSONDB for data storage and doesn't require any setup as such.

## Notes

The implementation of the algorithm to create the questionare is best-effort, meaning it tries its best to fit to the query, instead of throwing an error, for inexact input.
